## REPL

* R works using what is known as a REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop)

	* R waits for user input when it starts
	
	* User types input _expression_ and presses `Enter`
	
	* R reads input and tries to _evaluate_
	
	* Evaluation is either successful or produces an error
	
	* R starts to wait again for further user input
	
* Today's talk takes a closer look at _how the evaluation step works_

## Evaluation

---

* Consider the following expression that we wish to evaluate



```r
sqrt(x)
```

```
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'x' not found
```

* This expression involves two "symbols", `sqrt` and `x`

* To be able to evaluate the expression, R must be able to "find" both symbols


```r
find("sqrt")
```

```
[1] "package:base"
```

```r
find("x") # not found
```

```
character(0)
```


---

* So let us define `x` and try again


```r
x <- 10
sqrt(x)
```

```
[1] 3.162278
```

```r
x <- -1
sqrt(x)
```

```
Warning in sqrt(x): NaNs produced
```

```
[1] NaN
```


---


```r
x <- -1+0i
sqrt(x)
```

```
[1] 0+1i
```

```r
x <- "-1"
sqrt(x)
```

```
Error in sqrt(x): non-numeric argument to mathematical function
```

---

* Let us check again where `sqrt` and `x` are found


```r
find("sqrt")
```

```
[1] "package:base"
```

```r
find("x")
```

```
[1] ".GlobalEnv"
```

---

* Suppose we want to define a "smarter" `sqrt()`

* First check what `sqrt()` does, so we can mimic:


```r
sqrt
```

```
function (x)  .Primitive("sqrt")
```

* What does `.Primitive()` do? See `help(.Primitive)` (but we don't really need to know)

---

* define a "smart" `sqrt()` as follows:


```r
sqrt <- function(x)
{
    orig.sqrt <- .Primitive("sqrt")
    if (is.character(x)) x <- as.numeric(x)
    if (is.numeric(x) && any(x < 0)) x <- complex(real = x, imaginary = 0)
    orig.sqrt(x)
}
```

* We now have


```r
x <- -1
sqrt(x)
```

```
[1] 0+1i
```

---

layout: false

## Multiple symbol definitions

* Where is R finding these symbols?


```r
find("x")
```

```
[1] ".GlobalEnv"
```

```r
find("sqrt")
```

```
[1] ".GlobalEnv"   "package:base"
```

* Note that the "original" `sqrt()` is not overwritten; instead a new
  one is defined


---

## The search path

* Why is it using the `sqrt` in `".GlobalEnv"` and not the one in `"package:base"`?


```r
search()
```

```
 [1] ".GlobalEnv"        "package:knitr"     "package:stats"     "package:graphics" 
 [5] "package:grDevices" "package:utils"     "package:datasets"  "package:methods"  
 [9] "Autoloads"         "package:base"     
```

* R searches for symbols sequentially in the "search path"


---

## Environments

* What exactly are the objects in the search path?

* They are known as "environments", which are central to how evaluation works in R

* In essence, an environment is a _collection of symbols_ (variables)
  bound to _certain values_
  
* Each environment usually also has an associated "enclosing
  environment" or "parent environment"

* `.GlobalEnv` is the environment where user-defined variables are stored 

---

## Environments

* The chain of enclosing environments starting from `.GlobalEnv` is
  identical to the search path



```r
e <- .GlobalEnv
while (TRUE) { str(e, give.attr = FALSE); e <- parent.env(e) }
```

```
<environment: R_GlobalEnv> 
<environment: package:knitr> 
<environment: package:stats> 
<environment: package:graphics> 
<environment: package:grDevices> 
<environment: package:utils> 
<environment: package:datasets> 
<environment: package:methods> 
<environment: 0x55758e08dfa8> 
<environment: base> 
<environment: R_EmptyEnv> 
```

```
Error in parent.env(e): the empty environment has no parent
```

```r
search() # compare
```

```
 [1] ".GlobalEnv"        "package:knitr"     "package:stats"     "package:graphics" 
 [5] "package:grDevices" "package:utils"     "package:datasets"  "package:methods"  
 [9] "Autoloads"         "package:base"     
```


---

## Creating and manipulating environments

* `new.env()` explicitly creates environments

* Variables inside environments can be accessed using `$` (like lists or data frames)



```r
e1 <- new.env()
e1$x <- seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 101)
e1$y <- cos(e1$x)
plot(y ~ x, data = e1, type = "l", ylim = c(-1, 1)) # Formula interface
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-12](figures/eval-unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)



---

## Environments are not duplicated when copied

* Environments are an exception to R's duplicate-on-copy rule

* A copy of an environment is the same environment, not a new one


```r
e2 <- e1
range(e1$y)
```

```
[1] -1  1
```

```r
e2$y <- abs(e2$y)
range(e1$y) # changes even though e1$y has not been directly modified 
```

```
[1] 1.608123e-16 1.000000e+00
```


---

## Inspecting the variables in an environment

* The names of objects available in an environment can be obtained by `ls()`


```r
ls(e2)
```

```
[1] "x" "y"
```

```r
ls.str(e2) ## summary of all objects in e2
```

```
x :  num [1:101] 0 0.0628 0.1257 0.1885 0.2513 ...
y :  num [1:101] 1 0.998 0.992 0.982 0.969 ...
```


---

## Environments and functions

* Environments are central to how R functions work

* Functions in R are actually ["closures"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)

* In addition to the argument list and body (code), a function also
  has an associated environment

* This is usually the environment in which the function was defined

  

```r
environment(sqrt)
```

```
<environment: R_GlobalEnv>
```

```r
environment(base::sqrt) # special "primitive" (C) function, so no environment
```

```
NULL
```

```r
environment(hist)
```

```
<environment: namespace:graphics>
```


---

## What happens when a function is executed?

* Every time a function is invoked, a new environment is created

* This is the "evaluation environment" and contains the local variables of the function

* The environment of the function is the environment enclosing this "evaluation environment"
  
--

* While the function is running, evaluation tries to find symbols as follows:

	* First, in the evaluation environment
	
	* Next, in its enclosing environment, i.e., the environment of the function
	
	* Then, in the enclosing environment of that environment, and so on

* This behaviour is called "__lexical scoping__"
--

* Evaluation in the global environment follows the same rule (hence the search path)

---

## Are these details important to know?

* Depends!

* You can use R productively with only a superficial understanding of evaluation

* However, these details often help explain and diagnose seemingly odd behaviour

* They can also be a lot of fun

---

layout: true

## Scoping rules can mask errors

---

* Consider the following function which uses an undefined variable `lambda`



```r
boxcox <- function(x) # applies Box-Cox transformation on data 'x'
{
	if (lambda == 0) log(x)
	else (x^lambda - 1) / lambda
}
b <- function(x) # computes histogram bins given data 'x' 
{
    n <- sum(is.finite(x))
    r <- extendrange(x)
    seq(r[1], r[2], length.out = round(sqrt(n))+1)
}
```


```r
x <- rlnorm(1000)
hist(boxcox(x), breaks = b) # error, as it should be
```

```
Error in boxcox(x): object 'lambda' not found
```


---

* The same code will "work" if `lambda` happens to be defined


```r
lambda <- 0
hist(boxcox(x), breaks = b)  # notice that 'b' is a function! (See ?hist)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-18](figures/eval-unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)

---

layout: false

## But sometimes we _want_ to write such functions

* Normally, depending on this kind of scoping behaviour should be unnecessary

* In fact, a well-designed function should not depend on arbitrary variables

* However, there is one situation where this evaluation rule becomes important

* When a function creates and returns or uses another function!


---

## Do we need functions that create functions?

* Probably not very common...

* But only because we are limited in our thinking

* We already use functions as arguments to other functions

* Thinking "functionally" opens up many other interesting approaches

* This is particularly useful for quick prototyping


---

## Do we need functions that create functions?

* A somewhat silly extension of the example above:


```r
fboxcox <- function(lambda)
{
	f <- function(x)
	{
		if (lambda == 0) log(x)
		else (x^lambda - 1) / lambda
	}
    return(f)
}
```


```r
boxcox.sqrt <- fboxcox(0.5)
boxcox.log <- fboxcox(0)
```



---

## Do we need functions that create functions?


```r
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(boxcox.sqrt(x), breaks = b)
hist(boxcox.log(x), breaks = b)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-21](figures/eval-unnamed-chunk-21-1.png)

---

## Functions returned by functions

* Note that `boxcox.sqrt` and `boxcox.log` are both functions (created by
  another function `fboxcox`)


```r
boxcox.sqrt
```

```
function(x)
	{
		if (lambda == 0) log(x)
		else (x^lambda - 1) / lambda
	}
<environment: 0x55758ee03b40>
```

```r
boxcox.log
```

```
function(x)
	{
		if (lambda == 0) log(x)
		else (x^lambda - 1) / lambda
	}
<bytecode: 0x55758fc45430>
<environment: 0x55758e7a9af0>
```


* ... that appear to be identical


---

## Functions returned by functions

* But they have different "environments"


```r
environment(boxcox.sqrt)
```

```
<environment: 0x55758ee03b40>
```

```r
environment(boxcox.log)
```

```
<environment: 0x55758e7a9af0>
```


---

## Functions returned by functions

* This is because they were created in different executions of `fboxcox()`

* Although not immediately apparent, these environments retain the value of `lambda`


```r
ls.str(environment(boxcox.sqrt))
```

```
f : function (x)  
lambda :  num 0.5
```

```r
ls.str(environment(boxcox.log))
```

```
f : function (x)  
lambda :  num 0
```

---

## Functions returned by functions

* Without lexical scoping, this would not have been possible

* Another example from [The R Paper](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/downloads/R-paper.pdf):


```r
y <- 123
f <- function(x) {
    y <- x * x
	g <- function() print(y)
	g()
}
f(10)
```

```
[1] 100
```

* S, which is similar to R but does not have lexical scoping, would print `123`


---

## A more serious example

* Given positive-valued (possibly skewed) data, one may want to "transform" them to look normal

* The Box-Cox transformation is one family where one might search for an "optimum" choice

* A maximum-likelihood approach: assume $\lambda$-transformed data follow $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$

* A [little mathematics](https://www.isid.ac.in/~deepayan/RT2018/notes/systematic-violations.html#/the-box-cox-transformation-a-likelihood-based-approach) tells us that

	- There is no closed form solution for $\lambda$, but
	
	- The optimum (MLE) $\lambda$ can be found by minimizing
	$$
    \frac{n}{2} \left( \log 2 \pi + \log \hat{\sigma}^2(\lambda) + 1 \right) - (\lambda - 1) \sum \log \sub{x}{i}
	$$

	- where $\hat{\sigma}^2(\lambda)$ is the sample variance of the transformed data

---

layout: true

## A quick prototype

---

* Suppose we have a general numerical optimizer that can optimize a function of _one_ argument

* Make a function that converts data into a function suitable for optimization:


```r
negllBoxCox <- function(x)
{
    n <- length(x)
    slx <- sum(log(x)) # compute only once
    function(lambda) {
        y <- fboxcox(lambda)(x) # Note use of fboxcox() defined earlier
        sy <- mean((y - mean(y))^2)
        n * log(sy) / 2 - (lambda - 1) * slx
    }
}
```

---

* Let's compute the "negative log likelihood" function for some simulated data


```r
x <- rlnorm(100) # so lambda = 0
f <- negllBoxCox(x)
f(0)
```

```
[1] -1.304839
```

* We can can now use this function in any optimizer


```r
optimize(f, lower = -10, upper = 10)
```

```
$minimum
[1] 0.1822288

$objective
[1] -3.327372
```

```r
## OR optim(par = 1, fn = f) for alternative methods
```

---

* We can even plot the "likelihood function" — but first we have to "vectorize" our function

* The `Vectorize()` function creates a vectorized function from a non-vectorized one


```r
plot(Vectorize(negllBoxCox(x)), from = -4, to = 4, n = 1000)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-29](figures/eval-unnamed-chunk-29-1.png)

---

* Or we can do a quick simulation study of how well this method estimates $\lambda$ when $\lambda = 1$


```r
lambda.hat <-
    replicate(1000,
              optimize(negllBoxCox(rnorm(100, mean = 10)), lower = -10, upper = 10)$minimum)
hist(lambda.hat, breaks = b)
```

## Another example: linear regression with general loss function

* Another common use case: optimization of a loss function

* Consider the following general approach to linear regression given data $(\sub{x}{i}, \sub{y}{i}), i = 1,\dotsc,n$

<div>
$$
\hat{\beta} = \arg \min_{\beta} \sumlimits{i=1}{n} L(\sub{y}{i} - \sub{\beta}{0} - \sub{\beta}{1} \sub{x}{i}) = 
\arg \min_{\beta} f(\beta)
$$
</div>

* Common choices for $L$ are

	* $L(u) = u^2$

	* $L(u) = | u |$

	* <div>$L(u) = \begin{cases} 
	             u^2 & \lvert u \rvert \leq c \\ 
	             c (2 | u | - c) & \text{otherwise} 
			  \end{cases}$</div>


---

layout: true

## Objective functions (to be optimized)

---

* The following functions takes data and $L$, and creates a suitable objective function


```r
make.objective <- function(x, y, L = abs)
{
	function(beta) {
	    sum(L(y - beta[1] - beta[2] * x))
	}
}
data(phones, package = "MASS")
obj.lad <- with(phones, make.objective(year, calls, L = abs))
obj.lse <- with(phones, make.objective(year, calls, L = function(u) u*u))
```


---



```r
obj.lad
```

```
function(beta) {
	    sum(L(y - beta[1] - beta[2] * x))
	}
<environment: 0x55758e4461d0>
```

```r
environment(obj.lse)$L
```

```
function(u) u*u
<environment: 0x55758e287aa8>
```

```r
environment(obj.lad)$L
```

```
function (x)  .Primitive("abs")
```

## A more complex example

* Suppose we want to plot a histogram

* One important parameter is the bin width $h$

* Fixing starting point, what is an optimal choice?

* Maximum Likelihood fails because it "oversmooths", so needs regularization

* Options

	* [AIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion)

	* [cross validation](http://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/histogram/index.html)

---

## Minimize AIC

* The Akaike Information Criterion is a popular model selection criterion

* Simple definition: $2k - 2 \log(\hat{L})$ where 

	- $k$ is the number of parameters (here the number of bins)
	
	- $\hat{L}$ is the maximum likelihood (here the joint density under the histogram)
	
* Our prototype: make function of $k$ from input data

## Histogram AIC

        b <- seq(r[1], r[2], length.out = B + 1)
        h <- hist(x, breaks = b, plot = FALSE)

## Cross validation: summary


$\newcommand{\fhath}{\hat{f}_h}$

* Denote the histogram for bin width $h$ by $\fhath$, and the unknown density by $f$

* Want to choose $h$ to minimize integrated square error

$$
\int \left[ \fhath(x) - f(x) \right]^2 dx = 
\int \fhath(x)^2 dx - 2 \int \fhath(x)\, f(x)\, dx + \int f(x)^2 dx
$$

* The third term is unknown but constant (as $h$ varies), so can be dropped

* The first term can be calculated from $\fhath$ (which is piecewise constant)

* The second term involves the unknown $f$, but the integral can be viewed as $E(\fhath(X))$ when $X \sim f$


---

## Cross validation: summary

* Leave-one-out estimator: average of ${\fhath}_{(-i)}(x_i)$

* The estimated integrated square error (without the constant term) simplifies to

$$
\frac{2}{(n-1) h} - \frac{n+1}{(n-1) n^2 h} \sum_{k} c_k^2
$$

* where $c_k$ are bin counts

## Related topic: non-standard evaluation


* Again, consider an expression that will cause an error when evaluated



```r
rm(list = c("x", "y")) # remove x, y if defined earlier
plot(x, y, type = "l")
```

```
Error in plot(x, y, type = "l"): object 'x' not found
```



---

## Quoted (unevaluated) expressions

* R can actually work with an expression without evaluating it



```r
e <- quote(plot(x, y, type = "l"))
e
```

```
plot(x, y, type = "l")
```

```r
e[[1]]
```

```
plot
```

```r
e[[2]]
```

```
x
```

```r
e[[3]]
```

```
y
```

## Evaluating Quoted expressions

* A quoted expression can be evaluated using `eval()`


```r
eval(e)
```

```
Error in plot(x, y, type = "l"): object 'x' not found
```

* Fails because current environment (`.GlobalEnv`) does not contain variables `x` and `y`

* But Recall: Environment `e2` defined earlier contains 


```r
ls.str(e2)
```

```
x :  num [1:101] 0 0.0628 0.1257 0.1885 0.2513 ...
y :  num [1:101] 1 0.998 0.992 0.982 0.969 ...
```

## Evaluating Quoted expressions


```r
eval(e, envir = e2)
```

## Can we re-implement the `replicate()` function?

* This is how functions like `replicate()` and `with()` work


```r
my.replicate <- function(N, e)
{
    ans <- numeric(N)
    for (i in 1:N) ans[[i]] <- eval(e)
    ans
}
```


* But we have to be careful to use it


```r
my.replicate(5, max(rnorm(10))) # not what we wanted
```

```
[1] 2.075908 2.075908 2.075908 2.075908 2.075908
```

```r
my.replicate(5, quote(max(rnorm(10))))
```

```
[1] 1.063761 1.280337 1.456035 1.122466 1.335361
```

## Non-standard evaluation

* The `substitute()` trick: non-standard evaluation (using lazy argument evaluation)


```r
my.replicate <- function(N, e)
{
    expr <- substitute(e) # avoids the need to quote()
    ans <- numeric(N)
    for (i in 1:N) ans[[i]] <- eval(expr)
    ans
}
str(x <- my.replicate(1000, max(rnorm(20))))
```

```
 num [1:1000] 1.933 1.494 1.859 1.466 0.854 ...
```

---

## Lazy evaluation

* Lazy evaluation: function arguments are only evaluated when needed



```r
set.seed(20191105)
rm(sqrt) # remove the sqrt() we defined earlier
chooseOne <- function(a, b, u = runif(1))
{
    if (u < 0.5) a else b
}
chooseOne(sqrt(2), sqrt(-2)) # no warning message
```

```
[1] 1.414214
```

```r
chooseOne(sqrt(2), sqrt(-2)) # warning message
```

```
Warning in sqrt(-2): NaNs produced
```

```
[1] NaN
```
