* Goal: looking at current data, predict time to resource scarcity

* Motivation:

	- Strike balance between normal life and adverse health outcomes
	
	- Prevent unnecessary economic slowdown (due to restrictions)
	
	- Prevent avoidable deaths (due to lack of basic medical facilities)

	- Obvious strategies: vaccinate, ramp up healthcare facilities
	
	- But need to be prepared for surge (new mutations, loss of immunity, unknown factors)
	
	- Late reaction leaves lockdown as only solution, cannot prevent deaths
	
---
	
* Solution: With advance warning, we can deploy graded response

	- Communicate greater need for precautions and stricter social distancing
	
	- Stop mass gatherings
	
	- Close markets, cinema halls, gyms, etc.
	
	- Lockdown as extreme measure


---

* Proposal:

	- Simple scheme to predict number of active cases
	
	- Warning system based on zonewise ability to handle active cases


* Input requirements:

	- Daily number of confirmed / active cases (available from state bulletins)
	
	- Critical number of active cases (to be determined policymakers)

<!-- 
	- Number of active cases may be approximated, if necessary (e.g.,
      assuming 1% death rate, rest recovered 10 days after
      confirmation)

# Model

---

- $t$ unit of time (in days)

- $\confirmed{t}$ is the total number of confirmed cases upto time $t$

- $\active{t}$ is the total number of active cases upto time $t$

--

- $\ractive{t}$ is the _number of new infections per active infection per unit time_ at time $t$

	- __Changes with time__ [this is a very important point]
	
	- Depends on many factors: virus strain, social behaviour, vaccination

	- Can be influenced by policy

--

- $\rinactive{t}$ is the _number of deaths / recoveries
  per active infection per unit time_ at time $t$
  
    - Assumed constant: $\rinactive{t} \equiv 1/10$

--

- A simple evolution model: 
$$
\active{t + h} - \active{t} \approx h \cdot \active{t} \cdot [ \ractive{t} - \rinactive{t} ]
$$

---

- This gives an instantaneous definition of $\ractive{t}$ as
<div>
\begin{eqnarray*}
\ractive{t} &=& \rinactive{t} + \frac{\dactive{t}}{\active{t}} \\
            &\approx& \rinactive{t} + \frac{ \active{t + h} - \active{t} }{ h \cdot \active{t} }
\end{eqnarray*}
</div>

- Smallest possible $h = 1$, but we use $h = 7$ to reduce day-of-the-week patterns

- NOTE: This is unrealistic because assumes susceptible population _does not decrease_, but

	- We are only interested in estimating $\lambda(t)$ locally
	
	- The goal is to _warn_ when cases are _low_, when this is a mostly reasonable assumption

<!--  

- Alternative model 1: 
$$
\confirmed{t + h} - \confirmed{t} \approx h \cdot \active{t} \cdot \rconfirmed{t}
$$

- Estimate:
$$
\rconfirmed{t} = \frac{ \confirmed{t + h} - \confirmed{t} }{ h \cdot \active{t} }
$$

- Alternative model 2 (direct estimate from definition):
$$
\frac{\confirmed{t + h} - \confirmed{t}}{\confirmed{t} - \confirmed{t-h}} 
\approx h \cdot \active{t} \cdot \rincrement{t}
$$

- It turns out that $\ractive{t}$ and $\rincrement{t}$ behave
  similarly, $\rconfirmed{t}$ is a bit different

-->

---

- Prediction equations:

<div>
\begin{eqnarray*}
\active{s} &=& \active{s-h} + h \cdot \active{s-h} \, [ \ractivehat{s-h} - \rinactive{s-h} ] \\
&=& \active{s-h} \left( 1 + h \cdot [ \ractivehat{s-h} - \rinactive{s-h} ] \right)
\end{eqnarray*}
</div>

- Question: How to estimate $\ractive{s-h}$ a function of $h$?

# Results

---

- Calculations based on data from [covid19india.org](https://covid19india.org)

- $\confirmed{t} = \text{ Confirmed (cumulative)}$

- $\active{t} = \confirmed{t} - \text{ Recovered } - \text{ Deceased }$

- Observations:

	- $\ractive{t}$ is __not__ locally constant (many infection models assume constant) 

	- Shows periodic stretches of growth and decline
	
	- No systematic pattern
	
	- Likely combination of biological (variants / vaccination) and social (behaviour) factors

	- Difficult to predict

# Predicting $\ractive{s}$ for future time $s$

- Prediction can be meaningful only for short ranges

- We estimate $\ractive{s-h}$ as a linear function of $h$:

	- Start from the last calculated value on date of prediction

	- Linear slope estimated as average of last two changes
	
- For robustness, we take average over last 5 values

	- Start from average of last 5 calculated values of $\ractive{t}$ on date of prediction

	- Linear slope estimated as average of last 4 changes

--

- Note that 

	- $\ractive{s} > 0.1$ implies active cases will _increase_ over time 

	- $\ractive{s} < 0.1$ implies active cases will _decrease_ over time 



<!-- - Justification: False alarm better than no alarm -->


<!--  

- Other models can similarly predict $\active{t}$

- But this seems most stable (TODO: re-check implementations), so only one reported here

- Things to keep in mind:

	- Predictions can change dramatically over the course of a few days
	
	- Long-range predictions should _not_ be taken too seriously (assumes linear form)
	
	- More important to track $\ractive{t}$
	
- However, local trends in $\ractive{t}$ __can__ give early warning
	
	- Can indicate upcoming surge
	
	- Can detect upcoming peaks (inflection points)
	
	- Trends easier to spot than from plot of raw active counts

	- Should be considered an exploratory summary measure to guide policy / behaviour
