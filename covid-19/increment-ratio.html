title: Measuring How Fast COVID Infections are Spreading in India
author: Deepayan Sarkar
mathjax: true

# Background

* Trying to measure growth rate rather than absolute number of cases

* The usual motivations:

	- Want something that can be compared across time and location
	
	- Something that should not depend on degree of systematic under-reporting

	- Something that should not be overly affected by daily fluctuations and patterns


* Measure used: number of new cases in _last seven days_ divided by number in _previous seven days_ 

* Anything higher than 1 is bad on a sustained basis, but more than 2 is _really_ bad

# Urban vs Rural

- In many states, COVID numbers were dominated by urban areas

- Has the pattern of growth been similar in urban vs rural?

- Has the pattern changed, especially due to the elections in March and April?

- In the following plots, "urban" districts are those within a state
  that cumulatively accounted for more than 50% of cases till March 1

# Data quality: estimating death rate

- Kerala and Karnataka seem not to have controlled their growth

- In contrast, most North Indian states seem to be "improving" despite no obvious explanation

- Could this be due to under-reporting, whether due to strain on
  testing infrastructure or other reasons?

- One way to indirectly check this is to look at deaths vs cases

- The premise is that deaths will be reported more reliably than cases

- To account for lag, we compare new deaths in a 7-day window with new
  cases in the previous 7-day window

- Unfortunately, this only shows that data quality has been inconsistent
  throughout in most states
