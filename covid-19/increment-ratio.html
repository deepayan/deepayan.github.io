title: Measuring How Fast COVID Infections are Spreading in India
author: Deepayan Sarkar
mathjax: true

# Background

* Trying to measure growth rate rather than absolute number of cases

* The usual motivations:

	- Want something that can be compared across time and location
	
	- Something that should not depend on degree of systematic under-reporting

	- Something that should not be overly affected by daily fluctuations and patterns


* Measure used: number of new cases in _last seven days_ divided by number in _previous seven days_ 

* Anything higher than 1 is bad on a sustained basis, but more than 2 is _really_ bad
