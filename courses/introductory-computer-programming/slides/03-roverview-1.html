# Software for Statistics

- Computation is an essential part of modern statistics

    - Handling large datasets 

    - Visualization

    - Simulation

    - Iterative methods 

- Many softwares are available for such computation, but we will focus on R
--

- Why R?

    - Available as [Free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement) / 
    	  [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Source_Definition) Software

    - Very popular (both academia and industry)

    - Easy to try out on your own
--

- Also because I know R better than other languages

- Python and Julia are other good alternatives


---

# Outline

- Installing R (hopefully most of you have already done this)

- Basics of using R

- Some examples


---

# Installing R

* R is most commonly used as a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop) (Read-Eval-Print-Loop)

	* When it is started, R Waits for user input

	* Evaluates and prints result

	* Waits for more input
--

* There are several different _interfaces_ to do this

* R itself works on many platforms (Windows, Mac, UNIX, Linux)

* Some interfaces are platform-specific, some work on most
--

* R and the interface may need to be installed separately


---

# Installing R

* Go to <https://cran.r-project.org/> (or choose a [mirror](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) first)

* Follow instructions depending on your platform (Windows for most of you)
--

* This will install R, as well as a default graphical interface on Windows and Mac
--

* I will recommend a different interface called
  [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) that needs to be installed separately
  
* I personally use yet another interface called
  [ESS](https://ess.r-project.org/) with a general-purpose
  editor called [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)


---

# Running R

* Once installed, you can start the appropriate interface (or R directly) to get something like this:

```

```

* The `>` represents a _prompt_ indicating that R is waiting for input.

* The difficult part is to learn what to do next

# R is in fact a full programming language

* Variables

* Functions

* Control flow structures

	* For loops, while loops

	* If-then-else (branching)
--

* Distinguishing features

	* Focus on _vectors_ and _vectorized operations_ 

	* Treatment of _functions_ at par with other object types


* We will next see a few examples to illustrate what I mean by this
