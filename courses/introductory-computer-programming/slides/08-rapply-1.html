<!--  

# Topics 

* Replicating a simulation experiment

* The `*apply()` family of functions

* Functions can be arguments of other functions

* `do.call()`

-->


# Loop alternatives

* R has several general purpose functions that provide alternatives to loops

* We will discuss two of the main approaches today: 

	- `replicate()` for repeating a simulation experiment
	
	- Various `*apply()` functions to loop over varying function arguments 

* These are not necessarily more efficient than loops (unlike true vectorized operations)

* However, they are conceptually simpler (and easier to parallelize)

# Replicating a simulation experiment

---

* Consider this example from our previous assignment:


```r
n <- 20
x <- sample(n, 2)
max(x) %% min(x) == 0
```

```
[1] FALSE
```

* To estimate the probability of this event, we want to run it several
  times and compute proportion

---

* We have seen how to do this using a loop

* An alternative approach is to use the `replicate()` function


```r
replicate(10, {
    x <- sample(n, 2)
    max(x) %% min(x) == 0
})
```

```
 [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
```

* `replicate()` takes the _expression_ supplied as its second argument
  and evauates it multiple times


```r
s <- replicate(5000, {
    x <- sample(n, 2)
    max(x) %% min(x) == 0
})
sum(s) / length(s) # estimated probability of success
```

```
[1] 0.2344
```

# Return value of `replicate()`

---

* The return value of `replicate()` depends on what the expression returns when evaluated

* In the above example, each evaluation results in a scalar logical

* In that case, the results are aggregated to produce a vector
--

* If the result is always a vector of same length (greater than one), the result is combined into a matrix


```r
quantile(rnorm(500), probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
```

```
       25%        50%        75% 
-0.6950208 -0.0149650  0.6632904 
```

```r
replicate(6, quantile(rnorm(500), probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)))
```

```
           [,1]        [,2]        [,3]       [,4]        [,5]        [,6]

```

---

* If the result has inconsistent length, the result is a list


```r
set.seed(20200101)
replicate(6, unique(sample(10, 5, replace = TRUE)))
```

```
[[1]]
[1] 1 4 5 8

[[2]]
[1] 4 7 8 6

[[3]]
[1] 10  9  5  2  1

[[4]]
[1] 6 4 1 2

[[5]]
[1] 6 9 2 3

[[6]]
[1] 1 9 6 2 4
```

---

* This may sometimes lead to unanticipated behaviour


```r
set.seed(20200101)
replicate(2, unique(sample(10, 5, replace = TRUE)))
```

```
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    4
[2,]    4    7
[3,]    5    8
[4,]    8    6
```
--

* When output length is known to be variable, it is better to
  explicitly disable simplification


```r
set.seed(20200101)
replicate(2, unique(sample(10, 5, replace = TRUE)), simplify = FALSE) # always return list
```

```
[[1]]
[1] 1 4 5 8

[[2]]
[1] 4 7 8 6
```
