# General lower bound for comparison-based sort

<div>
$$
\newcommand{\sub}[2]{ {#1}_{#2} }
\newcommand{\sumlimits}[2]{ \sum\limits_{#1}^{#2} }
$$
</div>

* For example, this is what happens when we do insertion sort on three
  elements $\sub{a}{1}, \sub{a}{2}, \sub{a}{3}$

* Here, $i \leq j$ denotes the act of comparing $\sub{a}{i}$ and $\sub{a}{j}$

# General lower bound for comparison-based sort

* Generally, this decision tree must be a _binary_ tree (two outcomes
  of each comparison)

* It must have at least $n!$ leaf nodes (one or more for each possible permutation)

* Comparisons needed to reach a particular leaf: length of the path
  from the root node
--

* The worst case number of comparisons is the height of the binary
  tree (longest path)

* A binary tree of height $h$ can have at most $2^h$ leaf nodes
--

* A binary tree with at least $n!$ leaf nodes must have height $h \geq \log_2 n!$

* Using [Stirling's
  approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation)
  $\log n! = n \log n - n + O(\log n)$,

$$
h \geq \log_2(n!) / \log_2(2) = \Theta(n \log n)
$$

# Linear time sorting

* Sorting can be done in linear time in some special cases

* As shown above, they cannot be comparison-based algorithms

* Usually, these algorithms put restrictions on possible values in the input array
---

* Example: Input consists of letters (lexical / dictionary sorting)

* Common methods:

	* Counting sort
	
	* Radix sort

* Details left for a second semester project

# Randomly permuting arrays

---

* A common requirement in randomized algorithms is to find a random
  permutation of an input array

* One option: assign random key values to each element, then sort the
  elements according to these keys
  
.algorithm[
.name[`PERMUTE-BY-SORTING(A)`]
n = length(A)
let P[1, ..., n] be a new array
__for__ (i = 1, ..., n) {
    P[i] = RANDOM(1, M)
}
sort A, using P as sort keys
]

* Here $M$ should large enough that the possibility of keys being
  duplicated is small
--

* Exercise: 

	- Assume that all key values are distinct 
	- Show that `PERMUTE-BY-SORTING` produces a uniform random permutation of the input


---

* The runtime for `PERMUTE-BY-SORTING` will be $\Omega(n \log_2 n)$ if we
  use a comparison sort

* A better method for generating a random permutation is to permute the
  given array in place
--
  
* The following algorithm does so in $\Theta(n)$ time

.algorithm[
.name[`RANDOMIZE-IN-PLACE(A)`]
n = length(A)
__for__ (i = 1, ..., n) {
    swap(A[i], A[ RANDOM(i, n) ])
}
]

* In the $i$th iteration, $A[i]$ is chosen randomly from among $A[i],
  A[i+1], ..., A[n]$

* Subsequent to the ith iteration, $A[i]$ is never altered.

---

* Procedure `RANDOMIZE-IN-PLACE` computes a uniform random permutation

* We prove this using the following loop invariant

	> Just prior to the $i$th iteration of the for loop, for each
	> possible $(i-1)$-permutation of the $n$ elements, the subarray
	> $A[1,...,i-1]$ contains this $(i-1)$-permutation with
	> probability $(n-i+1)!/n!$.\

### Initialization

* Holds trivially ($i-1=0$)

* If this is not convincing, take (just before) $i=2$ to be the
  initial step


---

### Maintenance 

* Assume true upto $i=1,...,k$

* Consider what happens just before $i=(k+1)$th iteration (i.e., just after $k$th iteration)

* Let $(\sub{X}1, \sub{X}2, ..., \sub{X}k)$ be the random variable denoting the observed
permutation

*  For any specific $k$-permutation $(\sub{x}1, \sub{x}2, ..., \sub{x}k)$,

<div>
\begin{eqnarray*}
  P(\sub{X}1 = \sub{x}1, \sub{X}2 = \sub{x}2, ..., \sub{X}k = \sub{x}k) 
  &=& P(\sub{X}k = \sub{x}k | \sub{X}1 = \sub{x}1, \sub{X}2 = \sub{x}2, ..., \sub{X}{k-1} = \sub{x}{k-1}) \\
  & & \times  P(\sub{X}1 = \sub{x}1, \sub{X}2 = \sub{x}2, ..., \sub{X}{k-1} = \sub{x}{k-1}) \\
  &=& \frac{1}{n-k+1} \times \frac{(n-k+1)!}{n!} = \frac{(n-k)!}{n!}
\end{eqnarray*}
</div>
--

### Termination

* $i=n+1$, so each $n$-permutation is observed with probability $1/n!$
