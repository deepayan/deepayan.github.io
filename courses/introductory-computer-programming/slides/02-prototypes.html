# Outline

This set of slides outline a few prototype problems that we will use
as exercises throughout the course. The goal is the same in all cases,
namely, to go through the following steps:

1. Broadly outline a procedure to solve the problem

2. Write one or more algorithms to implement the procedure

3. Write an actual program to implement the procedure

4. Compare various solutions and improve upon them if possible

I will assign these steps as exercises at the appropriate time as we
go along.

# 1. Compute a probability

Given an integer $N$, choose two distinct numbers between $1$ and $N$
using [simple random
sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_random_sample) without
replacement. What is the probability that the smaller number exactly
divides the larger number?

# 2. Obtain maximum likelihood estimator

In many athletic events, such as javelin throw, the "performance" of
an athlete is measured by the best outcome of several attempts.

Suppose a javelin thrower participates in $n$ events in a year, and in
each event makes three attempts. Denote by $X\_{ik}$ the distance
thrown in the $k$-th attempt in the $i$-th event. However, only the
maximum $$ M\_i = \max \lbrace X\_{i1}, X\_{i2}, X\_{i3} \rbrace $$ is
observed for each event $i$.

Assume that $X_{ik}$ are distributed independently as $N(\mu,
\sigma^2)$. How would you find the MLEs of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$?

# 3. Estimate power curve

Suppose we want to compare the power of the two-sample $t$-test and
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for a very specific model:

<div>
\begin{eqnarray*}
X_1, X_2, \dotsc, X_n &\sim& U(0, 1) \\
X_1, X_2, \dotsc, X_n &\sim& U(\theta, 1) \\
H_0 : \theta = 0 &\text{ vs }& H_0 : \theta > 0
\end{eqnarray*}
</div>

To do this, we conduct a simulation study where we take $n = 20, 50,
100$ and $\theta = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5$, and replicate the
experiment 1000 times for each combination. For each such replication,
we compute and report the $p$-value of both tests.

A. Design such a simulation study. This is the more difficult part of
this exercise, so you can leave it till later, and instead use the
result from one such experiment, available [here](extra/simulation-study.csv).

B. Given the result of such a simulation study, compute and plot the
power curve of the two tests, at nominal level $\alpha = 0.05$, as a
function of $\theta$.

# 4. The Mandelbrot set

Finally, a fun exercise. $\newcommand{\CC}{\mathbb{C}}$ Consider the
function $f\_c: \CC \to \CC$ given by $f\_c(z) = z^2 + c$.  For any $c
\in \CC$, consider the recursively defined sequence given by

<div>
$$
z_0 = 0 + 0i,\quad
z_{n} = f_c(z_{n-1}), n \geq 1
$$
</div>

The [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) $M$
consists of all $c \in \CC$ such that this sequence does not
diverge. For a concrete practical definition, we can approximate $M$
by

<div>
$$
M_K = \lbrace c \in \CC : \lvert z_n \rvert \leq 2 \text{ after $K$ iterations } \rbrace
$$
</div>

Notice that the sequence is guaranteed to diverge if $\lvert z_n
\rvert > 2$ for some $n$.

The problem is as follows: Given $K$, $x_1 < x_2$, $y_1 < y_2$, and $M$

- Compute $M$ equally spaced numbers within the intervals $[x_1, x_2]$
  and $[y_1, y_2]$.
  
- For each resulting pair $(x, y)$, define $c = x + yi$, and record
  the first $n \leq K$ such that $\lvert z_n \rvert > 2$. If $\lvert
  z_K \rvert \leq 2$, record the result as $K$. Create a matrix
  storing these results.
  
- Create an image from this matrix.

The next slide shows what you might get for $[-2, 0.5] \times
[-1.25, 1.25]$ with $K = 200$.
