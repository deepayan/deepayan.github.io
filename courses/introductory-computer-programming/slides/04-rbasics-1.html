## Basics of using R

R is more flexible than a regular calculator

* In fact, R is a full programming language

* Most standard data analysis methods are already implemented

* Can be extended by writing add-on packages

* Thousands of add-on packages are available









---

## Major concepts

* Variables (in the context of programming)

* Data structures needed for data analyis

* Functions (set of instructions for performing a procedure)
---

## Variables

* Variables are symbols that may be associated with different values

* Computations involving variables are done using their current value


```r
x <- 10 # assignment
sqrt(x)
```

```
[1] 3.162278
```

```r
x <- -1
sqrt(x)
```

```
Warning in sqrt(x): NaNs produced
```

```
[1] NaN
```

```r
x <- -1+0i
sqrt(x)
```

```
[1] 0+1i
```
---

## Data structures for data analysis


* Vectors

* Matrices 

* Data frames (a spreadsheet-like data set)

* Lists (general collection of objects)

---

## Atomic vectors

* Indexed collection of homogeneous scalars, can be 

    * Numeric / Integer

    * Categorical (factor)

    * Character

    * Logical (`TRUE` / `FALSE`)
	
* Missing values are allowed, indicated as `NA`

* Elements are indexed starting from 1

* $i$th element of vector `x` can be extracted using `x[i]`

* There are also more sophisticated forms of (vector) indexing

---

## Atomic vectors: examples


```r
month.name # built-in 
```

```
 [1] "January"   "February"  "March"     "April"     "May"       "June"      "July"      "August"   
 [9] "September" "October"   "November"  "December" 
```

```r
x <- rnorm(10)
x
```

```
 [1] -0.78055750 -0.47482522 -0.06320542  0.39814161 -0.58225967 -0.88643170 -0.13622076  0.53026782
 [9] -0.60740655  0.18420291
```
--



```r
str(x) # useful function
```

```
 num [1:10] -0.7806 -0.4748 -0.0632 0.3981 -0.5823 ...
```

```r
str(month.name)
```

```
 chr [1:12] "January" "February" "March" "April" "May" "June" "July" "August" "September" ...
```
---

## Atomic vectors: examples


```r
m <- sample(1:12, 30, rep = TRUE)
m
```

```
 [1]  7  4  6 11  8  7 10  2 11 12  9 12  9  9  6  1  6 10  3  1 11 12  6  1  9  1 11 12  7  9
```

```r
mf <- factor(m, levels = 1:12, labels = month.name)
mf
```

```
 [1] July      April     June      November  August    July      October   February  November 
[10] December  September December  September September June      January   June      October  
[19] March     January   November  December  June      January   September January   November 
[28] December  July      September
12 Levels: January February March April May June July August September October ... December
```

```r
str(m)
```

```
 int [1:30] 7 4 6 11 8 7 10 2 11 12 ...
```

```r
str(mf)
```

```
 Factor w/ 12 levels "January","February",..: 7 4 6 11 8 7 10 2 11 12 ...
```

---

## Atomic vectors

* "Scalars" are just vectors of length 1


```r
str(numeric(2))
```

```
 num [1:2] 0 0
```

```r
str(numeric(1))
```

```
 num 0
```

```r
str(0)
```

```
 num 0
```
---

## Atomic vectors


* Vectors can have length zero 


```r
numeric(0)
```

```
numeric(0)
```

```r
logical(0)
```

```
logical(0)
```




---

## Types of indexing

* Indexing refers to extracting subsets of vectors (or other kinds of data)

* R supports several kinds of indexing:

	* Indexing by a vector of positive integers

	* Indexing by a vector of negative integers
	
	* Indexing by a logical vector

	* Indexing by a vector of names

---

## Types of indexing

* The "standard" C-like indexing with a scalar (vector of length 1):


```r
month.name[2] # the first index is 1, not 0
```

```
[1] "February"
```

* The "index" can also be an integer vector


```r
month.name[c(2, 4, 6, 9, 11)]
```

```
[1] "February"  "April"     "June"      "September" "November" 
```

* Elements can be repeated


```r
month.name[c(2, 2, 6, 4, 6, 11)]
```

```
[1] "February" "February" "June"     "April"    "June"     "November"
```


---

## Types of indexing

* "Out-of-bounds" indexing give `NA` (missing)


```r
month.name[13]
```

```
[1] NA
```

```r
seq(1, by = 2, length.out = 8)
```

```
[1]  1  3  5  7  9 11 13 15
```

```r
month.name[seq(1, by = 2, length.out = 8)]
```

```
[1] "January"   "March"     "May"       "July"      "September" "November"  NA          NA         
```


---

## Types of indexing

* Negative integers omit the specified entries


```r
month.name[-2]
```

```
 [1] "January"   "March"     "April"     "May"       "June"      "July"      "August"    "September"
 [9] "October"   "November"  "December" 
```

```r
month.name[-c(2, 4, 6, 9, 11)]
```

```
[1] "January"  "March"    "May"      "July"     "August"   "October"  "December"
```


* Cannot be mixed with positive integers


```r
month.name[c(2, -3)]
```

```
Error in month.name[c(2, -3)]: only 0's may be mixed with negative subscripts
```
---

## Types of indexing

* Zero has a special meaning - doesn't select anything


```r
month.name[0]
```

```
character(0)
```

```r
month.name[integer(0)] ## same as empty index
```

```
character(0)
```

```r
month.name[c(1, 2, 0, 11, 12)]
```

```
[1] "January"  "February" "November" "December"
```

```r
month.name[-c(1, 2, 0, 11, 12)]
```

```
[1] "March"     "April"     "May"       "June"      "July"      "August"    "September" "October"  
```
---

## Types of indexing

* Indexing by logical vector: select `TRUE` elements


```r
month.name[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)] # index replicated
```

```
[1] "January" "April"   "July"    "October"
```

```r
i <- substring(month.name, 1, 1) == "J"
i
```

```
 [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
```

```r
month.name[i]
```

```
[1] "January" "June"    "July"   
```

---

## Types of indexing

* Common use: extract subset satisfying a certain condition (also called "filtering")


```r
(x <- rnorm(20))
```

```
 [1] -1.7182806 -0.7979664 -1.4028834  0.1743817  0.1921853 -0.7001886  1.0550070  0.8688353
 [9]  1.9449993 -0.1246224 -2.4822167  0.8688252 -0.4832886 -0.9347962  0.6968943  0.5217189
[17] -0.5839191  3.1280052  1.2585589 -0.9629155
```

```r
x > 0
```

```
 [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
[17] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
```

```r
x[x > 0]
```

```
 [1] 0.1743817 0.1921853 1.0550070 0.8688353 1.9449993 0.8688252 0.6968943 0.5217189 3.1280052
[10] 1.2585589
```

```r
mean(x[x > 0])
```

```
[1] 1.070941
```


---

## Types of indexing

* Sometimes logical indexing can be replaced by integer indexing using `which()`


```r
i
```

```
 [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
```

```r
which(i)
```

```
[1] 1 6 7
```

```r
month.name[ which(i) ]
```

```
[1] "January" "June"    "July"   
```

```r
month.name[ -which(i) ] # same as month.name[ !i ]
```

```
[1] "February"  "March"     "April"     "May"       "August"    "September" "October"   "November" 
[9] "December" 
```
---

## Types of indexing

* But be careful about zero-length indices


```r
which(substring(month.name, 1, 1) == "B")
```

```
integer(0)
```

```r
month.name[ which( substring(month.name, 1, 1) == "B") ]
```

```
character(0)
```

```r
-which(substring(month.name, 1, 1) == "B") 
```

```
integer(0)
```

```r
month.name[ -which( substring(month.name, 1, 1) == "B") ]
```

```
character(0)
```


---

## Lists

* Lists are vectors with arbitrary types of components

* May or may not have names

* Usual vector indexing by `[` works in the usual way

* Individual elements can be extracted either by name (`$`) or by position `x[[i]]`

---

## Lists: examples


```r
ml <- list(imonth = m, fmonth = mf)
str(ml)
```

```
List of 2
 $ imonth: int [1:30] 7 4 6 11 8 7 10 2 11 12 ...
 $ fmonth: Factor w/ 12 levels "January","February",..: 7 4 6 11 8 7 10 2 11 12 ...
```
--



```r
ml$imonth
```

```
 [1]  7  4  6 11  8  7 10  2 11 12  9 12  9  9  6  1  6 10  3  1 11 12  6  1  9  1 11 12  7  9
```
--



```r
ml[[2]]
```

```
 [1] July      April     June      November  August    July      October   February  November 
[10] December  September December  September September June      January   June      October  
[19] March     January   November  December  June      January   September January   November 
[28] December  July      September
12 Levels: January February March April May June July August September October ... December
```

<!-- ml[["fmonth"]] -->

## Most common structures for statistical data

* Vectors, matrices / arrays: vectors with dimension


```r
VADeaths
```

```
      Rural Male Rural Female Urban Male Urban Female
50-54       11.7          8.7       15.4          8.4
55-59       18.1         11.7       24.3         13.6
60-64       26.9         20.3       37.0         19.3
65-69       41.0         30.9       54.6         35.1
70-74       66.0         54.3       71.1         50.0
```

```r
dim(VADeaths)
```

```
[1] 5 4
```
---

## Most common structures for statistical data

* Indexing works in same way, but in two dimensions


```r
VADeaths[1:2, c(2, 3)]
```

```
      Rural Female Urban Male
50-54          8.7       15.4
55-59         11.7       24.3
```

* Example: Indexing by "empty" index (selects all) and name


```r
VADeaths[, c("Rural Male", "Rural Female")]
```

```
      Rural Male Rural Female
50-54       11.7          8.7
55-59       18.1         11.7
60-64       26.9         20.3
65-69       41.0         30.9
70-74       66.0         54.3
```


---

## Most common structures for statistical data

* Data frames: lists that also behave like a matrix


```r
str(iris)
```

```
'data.frame':	150 obs. of  5 variables:
 $ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...
 $ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...
 $ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...
 $ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...
 $ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels "setosa","versicolor",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
```

```r
dim(iris)
```

```
[1] 150   5
```

## Data Frames

* Rectangular (matrix-like) structure

* Each column is a vector

* Different columns can have different types

* Every column must have a name
--

* Most built-in data sets in R are data frames

---

## Data input / output

* Statistical data are usually structured like a spreadsheet (e.g., Excel)

* Typical approach: read data from spreadsheet file into data frame

* Easiest route:

    * R itself cannot read Excel files directly

    * Save as CSV file from Excel

    * Read with `read.csv()` or `read.table()` (more flexible)

* Alternative option:

    * Use "Import Dataset" menu item in R Studio (requires add-on packages)

---

## Data input / output

* Data frames can be exported as a spreadsheet file using
  `write.csv()` or `write.table()`


```r
data(Cars93, package = "MASS")
write.csv(Cars93, file = "cars93.csv") # export
cars <- read.csv("cars93.csv") # import (path relative to working directory)
```



---

## Functions

* Most useful things in R happen by calling functions

* Functions have one or more arguments

    * All arguments have names

	* Arguments may be compulsory or optional

	* Optional arguments have "default" values 

	* Arguments may or may no be named

	* Optional arguments are usually named
	
* Functions normally also have a useful "return" value	

* For example, linear models are fit using the function `lm()`

## Other important features

* Getting help

* Generic functions and methods

* How matrices and arrays are implemented in R
