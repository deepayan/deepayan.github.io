First some basics.


# Boiled eggs

This is semi-trivial, but it is not always easy to avoid the shells
breaking too early.

- Place eggs in a pan and cover them with cool water (up to 1 inch
  over if possible)

- Cover the pan and bring water to a rolling boil over high heat

- Once water is boiling, boil on medium heat for 7 minutes more (for
  hard boiled eggs)


# Steaming / boiling vegetables

This is not a recipe per se, but a guideline for times appropriate for
vegetables when boiling or steaming (by which I mean either actual
steaming in a steamer, which I have never actually done yet, or
cooking something in oil on low heat).

- Potato - 15 mins

- Onion - 15 mins

- Broccoli - 5 mins

- Carrots - 5 mins

- Capsicum - 5 mins



# Fried Rice

Start with cooked rice that is non-sticky. Preferably long-grained
(e.g., basmati), add a little oil while cooking, and drain the
starch. Don't overcook.

Heat olive / sesame oil on high flame. 

Add the following, keeping flame high, and basically stirring continuously:

- chopped garlic (20--30 seconds)

- optional: mace and star anise

- chopped vegetables, e.g., carrot, peas, beans, capsicum (2 minutes)

- 2 eggs whisked (scramble and mix with vegetables)

- vinegar, salt, optionally soya sauce, etc.

- cooked rice

- pepper powder

Mix well, but not for too long (~2 minutes), as otherwise rice will
become dry.

The following recipes are my adaptations of something similar.


# Sooji pie

- Take sooji in a bowl and add enough water to just cover
  it. Optionally add a little ragi aata (and / or besan?). Cover and
  leave aside for at least half an hour

- Add yoghurt, leave aside for at least half an hour more

- Mix in 

	- one egg
	- chopped onion, 
	- tomato
	- water as desired
	- maybe a little crushed garlic (haven't tried)
	- salt, other spices (oregano etc.)
	- whatever else you wish: sausage / chicken bits / ...



# Stir-fried chicken


Cut boneless chicken into small slices. Marinate with yoghurt, ginger
garlic paste, salt, and garam masala powder. I usually marinate for a
few hours.

Put a large skillet on medium heat, and add

- Generous amount of olive oil and butter (until butter melts)
	
- minced garlic (at least 2 cloves) - 30 seconds

- marinated chicken

Cook covered on low / medium heat, stirring occasionally. The chicken
should let out water and steam initially, but the water should dry out
in about 30 minutes.

Optionally, add 

- potato sliced (I prefer a Belgian fries style cut)

- Onion thickly sliced

Cook for 10 minutes, then add

- Sliced capsicum

Cook for 5 more minutes. Don't overcook.
