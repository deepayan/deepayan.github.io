title: Expository material on R

This page gives links to slides of various talks and lectures on R
that I have given. It is not an exhaustive list, and only the latest
versions of essentially similar talks are included, although there is
sometimes substantial overlap.

The first set of slides are from a course on introductory programming
(mostly with R), so they proceed somewhat systematically. The focus is
more on the language and less on applications.
